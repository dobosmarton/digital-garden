description: Quick way to check what I'm up to these days.

## Where am I?

I'm a digital nomad, currently in my home, the US. Spending my days in the beautiful city of LA.

## What I'm working on currently?

1.  Working at my day job as a frontend engineer
2.  Developing indie-projects [like this developer blogging platform](https://github.com/thedevdavid/digital-garden)

## I am available for:

- public speaking
- content collaboration

## Am I available for freelance work/employment/co-founding/gardening?

Currently, I'm **not** available for employment-based work. I'm only considering unique/exciting projects for freelance work or consulting.

### How do I decide about a project if it sounds exciting?

I follow the **"Hell yeah! or No"** principle.
